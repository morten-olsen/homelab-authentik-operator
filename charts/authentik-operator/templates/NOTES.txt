Authentik Operator has been installed.

To verify the installation, you can run:
  kubectl get pods -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} -l "app.kubernetes.io/name={{ include "authentik-operator.name" . }},app.kubernetes.io/instance={{ .Release.Name }}"

Now you can create AuthentikServer and AuthentikClient resources.
Check the project samples at config/samples/ for inspiration.
